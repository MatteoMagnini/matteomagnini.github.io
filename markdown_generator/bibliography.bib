_abstract = {Medical chatbots are becoming essential components of telemedicine applications as tools to assist patients in the self-management of their conditions. This trend is particularly driven by advancements in natural language processing techniques with pre-trained language models (LMs). However, the integration of LMs into clinical environments faces challenges related to reliability and privacy concerns. This study seeks to address these issues by exploiting a privacy by design architectural solution that utilises the fully local deployment of open-source LMs. Specifically, to mitigate any risk of information leakage, we focus on evaluating the performance of open-source language models (SLMs) that can be deployed on personal devices, such as smartphones or laptops, without stringent hardware requirements. We assess the effectiveness of this solution adopting hypertension management as a case study. Models are evaluated across various tasks, including intent recognition and empathetic conversation, using Gemini Pro 1.5 as a benchmark. The results indicate that, for certain tasks such as intent recognition, Gemini outperforms other models. However, by employing the “large language model (LLM) as a judge” approach for semantic evaluation of response correctness, we found several models that demonstrate a close alignment with the ground truth. In conclusion, this study highlights the potential of locally deployed SLMs as components of medical chatbots, while addressing critical concerns related to privacy and reliability.}

_abstract = {Medical chatbots are becoming a basic component in telemedicine, propelled by advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, LLMs’ integration into clinical settings comes with several issues, with privacy concerns being particularly significant. The paper proposes a tailored architectural solution and an information workflow that address privacy issues, while preserving the benefits of LLMs. We examine two solutions to prevent the disclosure of sensitive information: (i) a filtering mechanism that processes sensitive data locally but leverage a robust OpenAI’s online LLM for engaging with the user effectively, and (ii) a fully local deployment of open-source LLMs. The effectiveness of these solutions is assessed in the context of hypertension management across various tasks, ranging from intent recognition to reliable and emphatic conversation. Interestingly, while the first solution proved to be more robust in intent recognition, an evaluation by domain experts of the models’ responses, based on reliability and empathetic principles, revealed that two out of six open LLMs received the highest scores. The study underscores the viability of incorporating LLMs into medical chatbots. In particular, our findings suggest that open LLMs can offer a privacy-preserving, yet promising, alternative to external LLM services, ensuring safer and more reliable telemedicine practices. Future efforts will focus on fine-tuning local models to enhance their performance across all tasks.}
