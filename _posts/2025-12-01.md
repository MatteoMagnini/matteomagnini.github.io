I am writing on the train to Venice, to take a flight to my new home: Luxembourg.
Just one month age I finished my PhD, and in less than 4 weeks I found a new job and an apartment.
I left the old one in the city center of Cesena in few days.
It was terrible staying there, especially during winter.
Being at the ground floor of an old building means lots of humidity and cold.
Too much to bear (and arguably at the border of legality).

The new apartment is exactly the opposite of the old one.
The new job is also very different to some extent.
Actually, it is a postdoc position (a.k.a., research specialist until I defend my thesis) at the University of Luxembourg.
So, it is a natural continuation of my PhD studies.
However, the environment, the services, the bureaucracy, and the country are all different (and hopefully much better).

My beloved wife accompanies me in this new adventure.
